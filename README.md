# Constraint-Dependent Emergence of Computational Paradigms

A rigorous investigation of whether ternary (three-state) computation emerges naturally under optimization pressure, using AI-assisted physics-based modeling.

## 📋 Executive Summary

This research definitively demonstrates that **computational paradigms are constraint-dependent, not universal optimization principles**. Through ~37,300 evolutionary runs across multiple optimizers, fitness functions, and energy models, we show that:

- **Ternary computation never emerges in continuous systems** (0% across all conditions)
- **Binary computation emerges robustly** under constraint (100% in binary-only regimes)
- **Ternary requires explicit discrete attractors** (quantizers) to manifest
- **Results are invariant** across optimization algorithms and objectives

## 🔬 Key Findings

| Constraint Regime | Binary (%) | Ternary (%) | Unary (%) |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Continuous-only   | 55         | **0**       | 45        |
| Binary-only       | **100**    | 0           | 0         |
| Discrete-only     | 0          | **100**     | 0         |

**Scientific Conclusion**: Binary computation's dominance reflects intrinsic optimization advantages under realistic physical constraints, not historical accident.

**How and why we got here** a through experiment to see what might be possible if just one non scientific person could interface with the AI of today back then. Start with the very basic discoveries of gates, binary, ternary, etc.. and see where it takes them. Could a new more efficient path be discovered using analog or something else? Was binary the easier choice or the most scientific efficient one? Could all of these power hungry computers have been created more efficiently. After all, we humans only require about 20 watts to run.
